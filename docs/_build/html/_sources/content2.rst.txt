Functions for modeling
======================

.. note:: The following functions are used for math modeling and analysis in Figure 2, 6 and in Suplementary Figure S4.

The basic model
---------------

.. note:: The following functions are used for the basic math model in Figure 2, where we assumed that actin filaments' assembly and disassembly rates lack orientation bias or dependence, and that filaments are rotated by a constant contraction rate.

.. automodule:: modeling.basic_model
	:members:

The differential turnover model
-------------------------------

.. note:: The following functions are used for the differential turnover model in Supplementary Figure S4, where we assumed that actin filaments' with correct orientations are protected from disassembly.

.. automodule:: modeling.diff_Trnv_model
	:members:

The Filament-Guide-Filament-Assembly model
------------------------------------------
.. note:: The following functions are used for the FGFA model in Figure 6, where we assumed that a portion of actin filaments assemble with the orientation of existing filaments.

.. automodule:: modeling.FGFA_model
	:members:

Additional functions
--------------------
.. note:: the following functions are used in multiple models to help build the model and/or analyze modeling results.

.. automodule:: modeling.extra
